# ColorDetector
To implement this color detector, we collected data using a Terasic digital camera with GPIO interface connected to a DE1_SoC board. We then process the data collected by performing a running average of the red, green, and blue elements on the screen and analyze it to determine the primary color captured by the camera module.
